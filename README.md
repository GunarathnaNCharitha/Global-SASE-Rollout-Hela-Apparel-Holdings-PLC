## 🌍 Project Overview
As the **Lead Engineer** at AcSys Networks, I spearheaded the design and deployment of **Palo Alto Prisma Access SASE** for **Hela Apparel Holdings PLC**, a global apparel manufacturer with operations in **Sri Lanka, Kenya, Ethiopia, Egypt, the US, UK, and France**.  

The project aimed to unify global security, simplify firewall management, and secure a hybrid workforce of 14,000 employees across multiple geographies.

## 🎯 Business Challenges
- **Fragmented firewall management** across multiple regions.  
- **Complex VPN setups**, creating duplicate policies per user.  
- **High licensing and operational costs** of multiple remote firewalls.  
- **Security gaps**, including lack of strong 2FA.  
- **Hybrid workforce support**, with dispersed users connecting over varied networks.  

---

## 🛠️ Tailored Solution
Implemented **Palo Alto Prisma Access SASE** as a **single-vendor cloud-delivered security framework**, integrated with Hela’s **Azure Cloud** infrastructure.  

**Key design elements:**  
- **Azure AD SAML SSO** for 2FA and role-based access.  
- **Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA)** policies across all sites.  
- **Unified Panorama Management** to streamline operations.  
- **Optimized global connectivity** with Prisma’s distributed gateways.
