## Project Overview
As the **Lead Engineer** at AcSys Networks, I spearheaded the design and deployment of **Palo Alto Prisma Access SASE** for **Hela Apparel Holdings PLC**, a global apparel manufacturer with operations in **Sri Lanka, Kenya, Ethiopia and Egypt**.  

The project aimed to unify global security, simplify firewall management, and secure a hybrid workforce of 14,000 employees across multiple geographies.  

---

## Business Challenges
- **Fragmented firewall management** across multiple regions.  
- **Complex VPN setups**, creating duplicate policies per user.  
- **High licensing and operational costs** of multiple remote firewalls.  
- **Security gaps**, including lack of strong 2FA.  
- **Hybrid workforce support**, with dispersed users connecting over varied networks.  

---

## Tailored Solution
Implemented **Palo Alto Prisma Access SASE** as a **single-vendor cloud-delivered security framework**, integrated with Hela’s **Azure Cloud** infrastructure.  

**Key design elements:**  
- **Azure AD SAML SSO** for 2FA and role-based access.  
- **Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA)** policies across all sites.  
- **Unified Panorama Management** to streamline operations.  
- **Optimized global connectivity** with Prisma’s distributed gateways.  

---

## Key Features Deployed
- **Unified Security Architecture**: FWaaS, SWG, DNS Security, ZTNA.  
- **Global Scalability**: Seamless coverage for multi-continent workforce.  
- **Zero Trust Security Model**: Identity-driven policies for users and devices.  
- **Cloud-Native Architecture**: Reduced infra complexity, future-proofing.  
- **Ultra-low Latency SLA**: <10ms inspection for optimal user experience.  
- **AI-Powered Threat Detection**: Leveraging Palo Alto Wildfire + Cortex.  

---

## Outcomes & Benefits
- **50% cost savings** by removing redundant remote firewalls.  
- **35% reduction** in VPN-related support tickets within the first month of deployment.
- **28% latency reduction** to critical apps (lab validation).  
- **Consistent global security posture** with Zero Trust enforcement.  
- **Streamlined operations** with single-pane management in Panorama.  

---

## My Role as Lead Engineer
- Conducted **end-to-end design and architecture workshops** with client CIO & IT teams.  
- Developed **deployment roadmap** balancing cost, performance, and compliance.  
- Led **cutover execution**, ensuring zero downtime during production rollout.  
- Oversaw **integration with Azure AD** for SAML authentication and 2FA.  
- Delivered **knowledge transfer sessions** for Hela’s IT admins.  
- Authored **change/rollback runbooks** and validation test plans.  

---


## Recognition
- Project cited internally as a **flagship global SASE deployment** at AcSys Networks.  
- Strengthened **long-term client partnership** with Hela Apparel Holdings.  

---

## Lessons Learned
- Zero Trust adoption requires **strong identity governance** upfront.  
- Pre-staging security objects avoids cutover delays.  
- Training client admins early ensures **smooth adoption post-deployment**.
